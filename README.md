# Italian Dodiom Corpus

This repository contains the Italian corpus collected through the Dodiom game, a collaborative project between NLP Research Group from the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering of Instanbul University and the UNIOR NLP Research Group.

The game has been experimented on two languages,namely Turkish and Italian, with the aim of building a corpus of multiword expressions both in their idiomatic and literal use through the gamified crowdsourcing approach.
